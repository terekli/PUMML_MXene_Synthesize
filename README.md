Prediction of Synthesis of 2D Metal Carbides and Nitrides (MXenes) and Their Precursors with Positive and Unlabeled Machine Learning.
This is a course project completed as part of my PhD program.

## Abstract
This project uses open source dataset and positive and unlabelled machine learning technique to predict synthesizability of MXene and MAX precursor. Detailed hyperparameter tuning is carried out to generate a model with true positive rate greater than 0.9. The finalized model is then used to predict that 155 unlabelled MAX and 19 unlabelled MXene could be synthesized. Analysis of the model output suggests unique result regarding synthesizability of MXene that is not reported in literature. A further analysis to match MXene with respective precursor suggest that only 11 MXene could be synthesized due to the lack of synthesizable MAX precursor. Overall, this project could push forward the discovery of new generation of MXene, which would greatly expand material selection freedom for high performance applica- tions.
